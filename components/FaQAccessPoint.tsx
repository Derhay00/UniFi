   <AccordionItem value="item-3">
    <AccordionTrigger>How do I power my APs?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
    Most APs require Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) which can be provided with a <a className="text-blue-600">UniFi PoE Switch</a> or a UniFi PoE Adapter. Make sure to check the deviceâ€™s store page when determining which <a className="text-blue-600">PoE Mode</a> is required.

    <p className="pt-3">Other APs, such as the U6 Extender, can be plugged directly into an AC outlet.</p>

   </AccordionItem>


   <AccordionItem value="item-4">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I wirelessly mesh my APs together?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
    Yes, all UniFi APs automatically form a mesh network, broadcasting the same WiFi so you can maintain connectivity while roaming between your access points.

    <p className="pt-3">Our APs also support wireless meshing to one another so you can eliminate dead zones without the need to run additional cabling. Simply plug your AP into a UniFi PoE Adapter connected to an AC power outlet within range of a nearby access point to enable setup.</p>

     <p className="pt-3">Note that meshing is not available for Standalone Access Points (without UniFi).</p>

    <AccordionContent>
